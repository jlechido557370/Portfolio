        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Jan Michael R. Lechido. I was born on September 28, 2005,
            in Davao City, Philippines. This autobiography shares my life story,
            personal experiences, and aspirations. I believe that every experience,
            whether good or challenging, plays an important role in shaping who we become.
        </p>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in Davao City, where I spent most of my childhood exploring
            my interests and discovering my talents. As a child, I enjoyed playing
            video games, drawing, and learning new things through technology.
            These early experiences helped develop my creativity, curiosity,
            and problem-solving skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently studying at the University of Mindanao as a Bachelor of
            Science in Information Technology (BSIT) undergraduate. My studies
            allow me to expand my knowledge in programming, web development,
            and computer systems. Education plays a vital role in improving my
            technical skills and preparing me for my future career in the IT industry.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy playing video games such as Dota 2, which
            helps me develop strategic thinking and teamwork skills. I also create
            art projects for income, combining creativity with entrepreneurship.
            Through these activities, I am able to relax, improve my skills,
            and earn extra money to support my personal goals and interests.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals & Dreams</h2>
        <p>
            My main goal in life is to complete my education and build a successful
            career in the field of Information Technology. I aspire to continuously
            improve my skills, achieve financial stability, and make a positive
            impact on my family and community. I believe that with dedication,
            hard work, and perseverance, I can turn my dreams into reality.
